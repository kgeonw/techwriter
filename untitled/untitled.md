# To become an API writer

**The attitude**

A developers’ technical writer needs to love APIs and SDKs. As far as you are concerned, they are the future of the universe. Immerse yourself in the concepts, and fly with the buzz words. Know what the cool kids are doing. Play with the technologies.

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) \(HM\) is a popular discussion site for devs. Drop in regularly on the [Hacker News Daily](http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/), to see the most popular topics of the day. HN has a good mix of tech topics, engineering of all sorts, political, social, and more. At first the tech topics will be foreign to you, but after a couple of weeks you’ll start pulling technologies together nicely.

> I think the best way to be a technical writer that writes developer documentation is to write some developer documentation. This is less obvious than it sounds. A good way to start would be to write a tutorial for some API, even if there’s already one or more tutorials available. It’s good practice for the writer, both as a matter of writing and of understanding the software. Another route is to make something and then document it. I did this recently with a ludicrously simple open source Python library that I wrote, but it was still warmly received and good practice writing docs and Python.

> Another good way to learn the technologies is to go to meetups for stuff you’re interested in. When I lived in Washington, DC, I loved going to the DC Python Meetup. I was sometimes out of my depth, but I learned something new, interesting, and useful every time. \(And I even got to give a presentation myself about creating documentation, so there was give as well as take\)
